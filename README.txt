About Sugoroku
Sugoroku is a genre of board games with 10 or more tiles that connect to form a completed story.
Players move around the board in 2 ways: along a designated path with dice rolls or to specific squares following the instructions on the square they landed on. You can play these types of game with as many people as you want. You can even play by yourself.
This site generates Sugoroku board games that are played with a 6 sided dice. Click the button below to generate a unique Sugoroku board game.

About Us
December 2017
We made this site to help people learn about this obscure and underappreciated genre of analog games, which is an ongoing research field at UCSC. The generator was created for Game AI class at UCSC.
This website is built with JavaScript and React.js, and the Board Generator is implemented using a variable-point crossover genetic algorithm in Python 3.6.
We are UCSC undergraduates studying Computer Science and Game Design! Hire Us!
